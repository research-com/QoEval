# Note regarding the files within this folder

This folder contains a slightly modified version of `__main__.py` of the [*Bufferer* Project](https://github.com/slhck/bufferer). 

Currently, we include the modified file directly (not as a git submodule) since we only use this one Python file
and want to reduce the complexity.

## Furter Information
For further information refer to the bufferer repo on github: https://github.com/slhck/bufferer.git
